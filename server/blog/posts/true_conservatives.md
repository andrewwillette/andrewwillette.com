# True Conservatives

Where are the true conservatives? Those who believe in small government and fiscal restraint?

The republican party we have now, this is not conservatism.

This is the desperation of a weakening middle class and it's opportunism. It's an asset-owning class, generally hard working, who is, I believe often times willfully, ignorant of monetary policy and how much it's screwed up this country.

Be kind to your friends and family and community! At least we can do that.
