# How I Practice Music

I approach practicing violin with the hope of the highest payout for the least effort. I have opinions on how to do this, I'd like to share them here.

I read that [Charlie Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker) could hear a melody and play it in all 12 keys, on the spot! From that, I take that he approached music in a way where melody and harmony were seen as a "relative" construct. The key was what set the tonic for the relative intervals. I had practiced scales and arpeggios semi-regularly up to that point, but learning about Charlie Parker's musical approach, I began doing something I think is novel and I now evangelize to anyone that will listen. Every day, practice for 5 or 10 minutes and play scales, arpeggios, licks, full melodies, in a given key, lets say A. The following day, do a similar practice routine of playing scales, arpeggios, licks, etc, but in the key of B flat, a half step up. The following day, same thing, but in B. And so on and so on.

Instrumental music is composed primarily of just three things; melody, harmony, and rhythm. The various items I play in the "key of the day" are intended to increase my ability to execute on these three areas. I'll list some here, but I don't want to set out what one should do. The important thing is to develop musical ideas in all 12 keys. You will begin to understand music at a much deeper level. A relative level.

- Scale starting from bottom on 1st degree, 2nd degree, etc (up to 7)
- Scale starting from top on 1st degree, 2nd degree, etc (up to 7)
- Arpeggio starting from bottom on 1st degree, 2nd degree, etc (up to 7)
- Arpeggio starting from top on 1st degree, 2nd degree, etc (up to 7)
- Fiddle, jazz, etc chord charts (I chord for 2 bars, then IV chord for 2 bars, then I chord for a bar, V for a bar, I for 2 bars). Understand there is so much useful skill to develop here!

All of these items should frequently be practiced with a metronom to develop the rhythm portion of your playing.

I've automated retrieval of the "key of the day". A primary reason being if I ever slack and don't practice it, I want it to feel like it keeps rolling. Try and take advantage. Some keys of the day are more fun to play around with.


I'd played a fair amount of violin by the time I had finished college. I found myself playing 30 minutes or so at my apartment with a concern that it was directionless. Learn more solo Bach?

## Outline
- How I practice music
- approach music in relative manner, practice all keys
- each day, practice chromatically up a step
    - today A, tomorrow Bb, etc
- Explain why I think effective practice is important
- Explain background of where I came to the method
