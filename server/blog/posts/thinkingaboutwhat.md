# Thinking About What?

It's 2024. I think at this stage of Twitter/Facebook/etc, personal website blogs are punk rock. I'm also copying my friend Ian Wold.

I plan to post about things I'm thinking about at the given time. That will defintely include software. It might include other topics. I hope to make it interesting.
