# The Need For Discipline in 2025 USA

Growing up I loved smoking and drinking. And I still do! But I've gradually cut back on both over the years in an effort to have a more focused, healthy life. One of the positive effects of exercising this discipline has been improvements in my mental clarity. It's got me thinking about discipline more generally.

I believe living in the USA in 2025 requires extreme discipline to keep a steady mind.

Before I dive into some of the new-age requirements for discipline that we face, I want to highlight something. I don't think it's reasonable to expect the majority of people to be able to exercise sufficient discipline across this wide variety of very addictive domains, we are not orthodox monks, and as a result things are going to continue to get stranger. I myself grapple with many of these issues, it's why I care to write this post. This nagging feeling of something going sideways that I sense so many people are feeling, it is not going to go away when Trump is gone, it may even continue to grow. It feels cyberpunk to me, things are getting stranger and much of it is downstream of what technology is making possible. In many ways it feels like the walk towards [wire-heading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirehead_(science_fiction\)).

New items that increase the "discipline requirements" of modern USA:

- the smart phone
- social media
- video games
- legalized marijuana
- legalized gambling in your pocket
- live sports content playing every hour of the day
- streaming services
- internet pornography
- online shopping
- remote work

The smart phone is clearly the biggest new phenomenon that increases the need for discipline. You know the reasons. Doom-scrolling, opening reddit every 5 minutes even though you don't care what's posted, tik-tok, the list goes on for negative aspects of that addictive distraction that sits in our pocket all day. I'd guess that a large portion of the US population is spending at least 30 minutes at both ends of sleep cycle (going to bed and waking up) consuming content that only harms their mental health. I struggle with that unless I charge my phone away from my bedside. "But it's my alarm!".

The topic of social media being addictive has been beaten to death. We all know. Nonetheless myself and many others waste hours every week reading through timelines we don't really need to be viewing so often. It leaves me feeling hollow.

If you're over 25 years old and you play video games for any significant amount of time, I challenge you to consider if it's building the life you want. I understand it's a dopamine hit and it's addictive. The same can be said about cigarettes. We should try to avoid cigarettes, too. And where cigarettes will likely take off some of the remaining years in old age, frequent video game use without question takes off some of the best years of your life when you could be developing yourself as an individual. I acknowledge many people disagree with me on this. I understand. I think they are wrong. They like the dopamine hit and stifle the nagging thoughts that they are wasting their life away on digital stiumlus. All that said, I smoke cigarettes occasionally!

Pot is legal now. Cool. As someone who has enjoyed weed most his young-adult life, I've always been paranoid about the need to exercise discipline if I'm going to be smoking weed. I'm confident some of that paranoia came from it being illegal. We now, legally and culturally, say it's A-OK to be smoking dope. I don't think it is. If you're going to do it, be very careful. It's the same issue with alcohol but I'm trying to limit this post to new phenomena that require discipline.

Online gambling is handicapping many people's chances at financial freedom. I've seen it myself a few times already. I'd label it straight up predatory. They advertise DraftKings during the games now. I'd also say this increases the amount of time wasted watching sports. "I'm watching this North Dakota State game because of my parlay!".

Related to sports gambling, there is an endless amount of live sports you can view every hour of the day. Soccer, football, basketball, horse racing, the list goes on. The same problem exists with streaming movies and web series. I'm not evangelizing going cold-turkey on these things but I bet we all know people that spends too much time watching streaming services and sports.

Internet pornography is an important topic to discuss here because I think it has had a drastic effect on our society and we don't talk about it much due to the taboo nature. Porn and online dating has messed up a lot of romance in this country. I'd label only the former as addictive but the combination has screwed up a lot of our social interactions in the world of intimacy.

Online shopping is a bit different than the others because it's easier to have a healthy relationship with it. It's incredibly convenient and increases the variety of goods available to us. But like online gambling, there is a similar risk to wasting significant amounts of money and time on unnecessary actions. And I've seen it become an addiction.

Remote work requires discipline. One doesn't have the in-person energy to help them stay focused. They don't have the convenience / ease of walking over to their colleague if they are running into issues and need help. They must learn to have the discipline to engage either async or over *another* zoom call. It's more difficult for their manager to be a force of order / discipline themselves. One could argue that it's good that management can't be such a force of discipline in remote work. Okay, fine. Like I said, the requirement for discipline is on the remote worker now. I've managed remote software teams the past couple years and have developed some strong opinions on this. I don't have a lot of patience for individuals who lack energy or effort in a remote setting, I'm not going to micro-manage them from Slack / Zoom. If someone consistently misses deliverables and they are not available and active, they need to develop some discipline or I'm advocating we let them go. Remote work is a privilege but it's a 2-sided sword.

I highlight these items because I think it is interesting, all these new phenomena that we must now engage with. I don't mean to promote a life that involves a total avoidance of all these things. I don't think that's reasonable. I strongly adhere to the saying of "all things in moderation". But next time you see an article on the topic of "the anxious generation" or however it's being pitched, I hope you remember this. I sympathize quite strongly with people around my age and younger (those exposed to iPhones at an early age). I think life is harder in a lot of not-obvious ways due to these addictive things.

I know it was true 500 years ago too, but I want to emphasize now in 2025 USA: discipline is the key to mental clarity and there is no shortcut. We must do our best to exercise it!
