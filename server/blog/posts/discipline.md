# Discipline in 2025 USA

I've cut back on a bit on drinking and smoking cigarettes over the years. I still do both sometimes! I've exercised some discipline to do it less than I used to, though. It's got me thinking about discipline more generally.

I believe living in the USA in 2025 requires a alot of discipline to keep a steady head. There's some distractions and not-great-for-you activities to do. It feels kind of cyberpunk to me. A lot of it is technology-based, addicting/domamine and enables wealth disparity by networks who run the services.

New items that increase the "discipline requirements" of modern USA:

- the smart phone
- social media
- video games
- legalized marijuana
- legalized gambling in your pocket
- live sports content playing every hour of the day
- streaming services
- online shopping

I try to limit these things. Stare at the wall instead. Talk/call your loved ones. Read a book. Play the guitar. It makes me sad when I see kids on iPads. I think their parents are setting them up badly.

These addictions are going to become more and more acute. What are the consequences? I'll give an example. A large portion of the college-educated individuals my age I speak with don't read books stating they "don't have the attention span". And we are a generation that's too old to have been iPad babies.
